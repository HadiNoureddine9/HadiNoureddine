Machine Learning (ZAKA AI Program - 20 Weeks)                 
June 2022 
June 2025 
Over a 20-week intensive program, I strengthened my machine learning and LLM engineering foundations by building real-world, 
end-to-end AI systems: 
• Transformed raw, messy datasets into clean, structured insights using Python (Pandas, NumPy). 
• Trained, tuned, and evaluated models with intention, applying gradient descent, regularization, cross-validation, and error 
analysis. 
• Studied deep learning fundamentals (Neural Networks, CNNs, Transformers) from first principles. 
• Built LLM-powered applications using modern models (GPT-5.1, Gemini 3) and agentic workflows. 
• Implemented autonomous AI agents capable of research, multi-step reasoning, web crawling, and data extraction. 
• Applied responsible MLOps practices including versioning, reproducibility, monitoring, and deployment pipelines. 
• Delivered production-grade, end-to-end ML projects aligned with real-world constraints and performance requirements.
## Design Preferences
Design Preferences

Ultra-clean, premium, modern aesthetic inspired by top developer portfolios: linear.app, vercel.com, stripe.com, and fellow top-tier engineers.

Minimalist design with strong visual hierarchy, spacious layout, and smooth micro-interactions (subtle hover, fade-in, and parallax effects).

Light/Dark mode with soft neutral colors: whites, dark grays, charcoal, with an accent color (electric blue / neon green / purple) used sparingly for highlights.

Typography pairing: Inter / Sora / Geist Sans for body + Clash Display / Plus Jakarta Sans for headings (bold and high-impact).

Components styled with rounded corners (12–24px), soft shadows, and glassmorphism only in small elements (cards, nav background).

Responsive 12-column grid, with mobile-first strategy and fluid spacing scale (8px system).

Portfolio sections feel like “product pages”: clean storytelling, sharp visuals, structured case studies, and problem-solution-impact flows.

Project cards use: image thumbnail, tech stack pills, role, impact metrics, and CTA buttons (GitHub / Live Demo).

Hero section should be bold and personal: large headline + high-quality professional photo + short value proposition.

About Me section structured like a narrative: expertise, impact, philosophy, timeline, certifications, achievements.

Skills displayed as categorized groups with icons, proficiency levels, and usage context (backend, frontend, cloud, DevOps, etc.).

Full CV/Resume page with downloadable PDF + rich structured data (experience, responsibilities, outcomes, metrics).

Contact section simple and clean with social icons, email button, optional contact form.

Accessibility-focused: proper contrast, semantic HTML tags, keyboard navigation, alt text for all media.

Subtle animations powered by Framer Motion or CSS transitions—never overwhelming, always purposeful.

Optimized for performance: compressed images, lazy loading, CDN hosting, minimal script usage.

Branding feels like a polished software engineer with strong backend + cloud background.

Overall experience should feel: premium, engineered, trustworthy, world-class.

# Mobile Design Preferences

Mobile-first layout with fluid spacing (6/12/18/24px) and vertically stacked sections for clarity.

Sticky top navigation with hamburger menu using smooth slide-in drawer.

Hero section optimized for one-screen impact: bold headline, short subtitle, and a strong CTA (Contact / Projects).

All typography scales responsively (Clamp CSS) to maintain hierarchy on small screens.

High-quality, optimized mobile-friendly images (WebP), lazy loaded for performance.

Project cards simplified: vertical layout, full-width thumbnails, clear action buttons, and tech-stack pills wrapped neatly.

Timeline, skills, and CV sections converted into collapsible accordions for clean browsing.

Cards and buttons use larger touch-friendly areas (44–48px height).

Smooth scroll animations only when needed, never heavy or laggy.

Bottom “Quick Contact Bar” option: email, GitHub, LinkedIn icons for fast access.

Dark/Light mode toggle accessible in the mobile nav drawer.

Auto-adjust layout to avoid layout shift when keyboard opens (forms, contact).

Complete accessibility compliance: readable contrast, screen-reader labels, proper focus states.

Zero clutter — everything essential, clean, and fast.
